### Plex Media Server Post Mortems & Lessons Learned
This repository is intended to act as a central repository for storing post mortems and lessons learned from various
 services that required corrections of some kind and how to go about it. 
 
 This is intended to be a reference point for Plex Media Server users who host their own server and want to learn
  from mistakes of their peers. This also exists as a place to open issues to discuss them with the community to
   collaborate on a resolution.
